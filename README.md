# Open Source Readiness Checklists

This project produces information about establishing a corporate open source compliance program -- in checklist form! There's lots of great information out there about setting up a compliance program -- ebooks, articles, the OpenChain Specification. This project seeks to capture the high-level components of an open source compliance program, as well as important processes, as checklists to be easily referenced by those building out a program.

The structure of the compliance program checklist is based partly on the structure set out in [Open Source Compliance in the Enterprise, 2nd edition](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/compliance-and-security/2018/12/open-source-compliance-in-the-enterprise/), by Ibrahim Haddad, which is a great long-form resource about building out an open source compliance program.
